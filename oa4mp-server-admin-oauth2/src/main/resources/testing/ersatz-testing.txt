The local set up for testing 𝕰𝖗s𝖆𝖙𝖟 clients.

This requires a client be in a VO and administered by it. On my local machine
admin id: admin:test/vo_1
provisioner id: localhost:command.line2
𝕰𝖗s𝖆𝖙𝖟 id: client:/my_ersatz

How to test.
You will need two running instances of oa2-client. One to provision and the other to
do the substitution.
** Make sure you do a valid flow for localhost:command.line2. Check the testing-readme.txt
** to see what the current state is!

1. Start flow for localhost:command.line2
   a. get the access token(s)
   b. save it to $ERSATZ

2. Start 𝕰𝖗s𝖆𝖙𝖟 client issue
   a. load  client:/my_ersatz
   b. read $ERSATZ -p
      (NOTE THE -p flag, which tells the system to provision from the stored state, rather than
       replace current state with it.)
   c. do token exchanges with -at (default) and -xt

You should be able to go to the oa2-cli and search for the transactions and tokens
that are associated with these clients.
